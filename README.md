# Discogs Yelp App

Nothing Discog-y about it. Just an app that loads some of my favorite Portland eateries from the Yelp GraphQL API.

This is a interview exercise project. Hope they dig it.

## What's Inside

- UI Build - Vite
- UI Framework - React
- Types - TypeScript
- CSS - Sass, BEM, Themes, Custom Properties (Variables)
- Cache - TanStack Query
- Routing - React Router
- State - React Router loaders
- Repo / Automation - You guessed it... Github / Actions
- Deployment - Cloudflare Worker Site using Wrangler

## What does it do?

The app fetches basic data from Yelp of some hard-coded eateries (using their alias IDs). This loads a list into the UI's homepage. Clicking on an item loads a 'Fav' page which queries Yelp for more data about the eatery (reviews, rating, address, etc). The reviews panel has a refresh button that invalidates the cache for that page and refetches it. The plan here was to see updates in the reviews list but they don't come in frequently enough. ðŸ«¤

Oh and it's set up to use your browser-preferred color theme (light, dark). So give your browser theme settings a toggle to check it out.

## Set-up

Things you'll need to run:

- A Yelp API Key with Developer Beta
- A `.env.development.local` env file in `app/src`. This allows Vite dev server to pick up the needed env variables. It should have:

  ```
  VITE_YELP_API_KEY=< API Key from Yelp>
  VITE_YELP_API_ENDPOINT=/graphql
  ```

- a `.dev.vars` env file in the project root. This is to make the API Key avaiable to the Worker when it's running locally. It should have:
  ```
  VITE_YELP_API_KEY=<API Key from your Yelp developer account>
  ```

## How it works

### Cloudflare Worker (local and prod)

The Worker serves static assets and also makes the `/graphql` queries. To run using Wrangler:

```
npm run dev
```

### Vite dev server

Vite server serves assets and proxies `/graphql` queries. To run using Vite:

```
npm run app
```

### React UI

The UI posts queries to the server (no CORS issues or exposed secrets) and then does fun stuff.

## Things I'd like to add

- Add SubPub to Yelp webhooks and send updates to UI via Server Sent Events
- Add Cloudflare binding to D1 to store favorites, and add or remove them
- Any GraphQL mutations... nothing I saw in Yelp API for updating user profile or posting reviews...
- Accessibility
  - Make it AA/AAA compliant (color contrast, keyboard access, ARIA properties, target size ... to start)
- Tests (more of a 'must' than a 'like')
  - Started on the this but couldn't get the configuration done fast enough
  - Want to use Mock Service Worker and Testing Library, but combined with GraphQL queries and React Router loaders, it was just too much to tackle in a short amount of time ðŸ˜ž

## Known Issues

- Rebuild of Vite on file changes doesn't trigger Wrangler dev restart (workaround: saving toml file triggers the Wrangler build)
- Not sure I've I'm catching all my errors and rejected promises... saw at least one UI blow-up when I hit the Yelp daily rate limit
